# Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree Curriculum & Projects
*Projects I realized to complete the Front-End Nanodegree program from Udacity*

## **1) Styled Blog Website**<br>
CSS & Website Layout

See the project live: [ON GITHUB PAGES](https://zh-betina.github.io/UDACITY---Personal-Blog/)<br>
Or check the project repository: [ON MY GITHUB](https://github.com/zh-betina/UDACITY---Personal-Blog)

<pre>Description: Create a multi-page blog website, using best practices for content and page styling with HTML and CSS. 
You’ll practice using responsive layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to create the structure and design for your own blog.</pre>

## **2) Dynamic Landing Page for Marketing Content**<br>
JavaScript and the DOM

See the project live: [ON GITHUB PAGES](https://zh-betina.github.io/UDACITY---Landing-Page/)<br>
Or check the project repository: [ON MY GITHUB](https://github.com/zh-betina/UDACITY---Landing-Page)

<pre>In this project, you will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, you won’t know how much content 
will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, you will dynamically
add content to a web page. You’ll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 
to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.</pre>

## **3) Weather Journal**<br>
Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications

See the project live: [ON HEROKU](https://secret-harbor-17931.herokuapp.com/)<br>
Or check the project repository: [ON MY GITHUB](https://github.com/zh-betina/UDACITY---Weather-Journal-App)

![Project screenshot](/UDweatJourn.png)

<pre>Apply your new skills to combine data from the OpenWeatherMap API and client side (browser) HTML forms 
to create a web app that records a weather journal for users. This project requires you to create an asynchronous 
web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather Journal App.</pre>

## **4) Article Analysis Website**<br>
Build Tools, Webpack, and Service Worker

Or check the project repository: [ON MY GITHUB](https://github.com/zh-betina/zh-betina-UDACITY---NLP-tool)

<pre>Build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found 
on other websites. Using an exciting new API called Aylien, you can build a simple web interface to interact 
with their NLP system. This tool will give back pertinent information about the article: whether the content 
is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.</pre>

## **5) Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone**<br>

See the project live: [ON HEROKU](https://trip-prepper.herokuapp.com/)<br>
Or check the project repository: [ON MY GITHUB](https://github.com/zh-betina/Travel-App)

<pre>In the final project, you’ll combine all of the skills you’ve developed throughout the Nanodegree program 
to build an online travel app. You’ll work with data sources from multiple APIs to create a dynamic travel weather 
planning application that helps people plan trips by generating weather forecasts for the places they’re visiting. 
The design is up to you, and you’ll have the flexibility to include and combine other APIs (even your own!) 
to build this final project.</pre>
